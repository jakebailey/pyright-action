GitHub action for [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). Featuring:

- PR/commit annotations for errors/warnings.
- Super fast startup, via:
  - Download caching.
  - No dependency on `setup-node`.

## Use with a virtualenv

The easiest way to use a virtualenv with this action is to "activate" the
environment by adding its bin to `$PATH`, then allowing `pyright` to find it
there.

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    cache: 'pip'

- run: |
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

- run: echo "$PWD/.venv/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

- uses: jakebailey/pyright-action@v2
```

## Use with poetry

Similarly to a virtualenv, the easiest way to get it working is to ensure that
poetry's python binary is on `$PATH`:

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3

- run: pipx install poetry
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    cache: 'poetry'

- run: poetry install
- run: echo "$(poetry env info --path)/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

- uses: jakebailey/pyright-action@v2
```

## Providing a pyright version sourced from preexisting dependencies

The `version` input only accepts "latest" or a specific version number. However,
there are many ways to use specify a version of `pyright` derived from other
tools.

### Using pyright from `$PATH`

If you have `pyright` installed in your environment, e.g. via the `pyright` PyPI
package, specify `version: PATH` to use the version that's on `$PATH`.

```yml
- run: |
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt # includes pyright

- run: echo "$PWD/.venv/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

- uses: jakebailey/pyright-action@v2
  with:
    version: PATH
```

### Keeping Pyright and Pylance in sync

If you use Pylance as your language server, you'll likely want pyright-action to
use the same version of `pyright` that Pylance does. The `pylance-version`
option makes this easy.

If you allow VS Code to auto-update Pylance, then set `pylance-version` to
`latest-release` if you use Pylance's Release builds, or `latest-prerelease` if
you use Pylance's Pre-Release builds. Alternatively, you can set it to a
particular Pylance version number (ex. `2023.11.11`).

Note that the `version` option takes precedence over `pylance-version`, so
you'll want to set one or the other, not both.

```yml
- uses: jakebailey/pyright-action@v2
  with:
    pylance-version: latest-release
```
